# Telemetry

Terraform Cloud Agents emit telemetry data using the
[OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) protocol.

## Configuration

To configure your agent to emit telemetry data, you must include the
`-otlp-address` flag or `TFC_AGENT_OTLP_ADDRESS` environment variable. This
should be set to the host:port address of an [OpenTelemetry
collector](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/concepts/data-collection/). This
address should be a GRPC server running an OLTP collector.

Optionally, you can pass the `-otlp-cert-file` or `TFC_AGENT_OTLP_CERT_FILE`.
The agent will use a certificate at the path supplied to encrypt the client
connection to the OpenTelemetry collector. When omitted, client connections are
not secured.

## Tracing

The agent emits tracing spans that can be consumed by various distributed
tracing tools. Information about supported tools can be found on the
[OpenTelemetry Registry](https://opentelemetry.io/registry/). A span is a
single unit of work performed by the agent.

Spans conform to the following rules:

* Each span has a unique name in plain English, explaining what it represents.
* Span attributes will be made up of sections, separated by periods. Sections
  will contain only alphanumeric characters and dashes.
  For example: `tfc.run.terraform-version`.
* Span attributes in the `tfc` namespace will have information relevant to the
  entire operation.
* Span attributes in the `debug` namespace will have information relevant to
  the current span's scope.

## Metrics

The Terraform Cloud Agent emits numerous metrics describing the agent's
performance. The metrics documented on this page are considered stable and will
not change in any significant way between stable releases of the same major
version.

### Metric data types

Terraform Cloud agents emit three types of metric data:

* Gauges submit an absolute number value at the end of an aggregation period.
* Counters accumulate number values during an aggregation period. At the end of
  an aggregation period, the sum of the numbers is recorded and the value reset
  to zero for the next period.
* Timers measure the time taken to complete a task.

### Metric naming conventions

An example of the metric names that the agent will emit is
`tfc-agent.terraform.plan-json.generate.bytes`. Breaking down those sections:

* `tfc-agent`: Metric names will be namespaced with tfc-agent to distinguish
  them from other metrics your system may be emitting.
* `terraform`: Metric names may have a prefix with a component name, when a
  component is applicable.
* `plan-json`: This shows that the metric in question is about the step of the
  agent process where JSON representations of the Terraform plan and Terraform
  provider schema are generated and uploaded.
* `generate`: Specifically, it is about the generation of the JSON artifacts.
* `bytes`: When a metric requires a unit in order to be understood, an un-
  abbreviated unit will be the last component of the metric name.

In addition, agent metrics will follow some conventions around unit types:

* All timing metrics (other than runtime metrics) will be measured in milliseconds.
* All data size metrics will be measured in bytes.

While all of the metric names emitted by the tfc-agent use hyphens, some systems
may automatically convert these to underscores.

### Core metrics

The following metrics are generated by the Terraform Cloud Agent core program,
and are related to generic operations performed regularly by all agents. All
metrics in this section are prefixed by `tfc-agent.`.

| Meric name                   | Type  | Description                                                          |
| ---------------------------- | ----- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `status.busy`                | Gauge | Number of agents in `busy` status.                                   |
| `status.idle`                | Gauge | Number of agents in `idle` status.                                   |
| `register.milliseconds`      | Timer | Time to register the agent with Terraform Cloud.                     |
| `fetch-job.milliseconds`     | Timer | Time to complete a job dequeue request.                              |
| `update-status.milliseconds` | Timer | Time to send a status update over from the agent to Terraform Cloud. |

### Runtime metrics

The Terraform Cloud Agent produces a number of metrics which are generated by
the application runtime, and are primarily useful in debugging the tfc-agent.
These metrics are emitted periodically throughout the entire agent process
lifecycle. It is important to note that these metrics do not represent a
complete picture of resource utilization by the agent. The agent may fork child
processes (such as the Terraform binary or other programs) which maintain their
own distinct runtimes and consume resources independently of the agent. To
monitor resource utilization comprehensively, consider monitoring VM or
container metrics. All metrics in this section are prefixed by
`tfc-agent.runtime.`.

| Meric name                      | Type  | Description                                         |

| `go.mem.heap-objects.count`     | Gauge | Number of allocated heap objects.                   |

| `go.mem.free.count`             | Gauge | Cumulative count of heap objects freed.             |
| `go.gc.count`                   | Gauge | Number of completed GC cycles.                      |
